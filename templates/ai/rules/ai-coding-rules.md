# AI Coding Rules

This file records stable AI coding rules. Do not load broad project knowledge
or historical process documents unless the current task needs them.

## Context Budget

- Default context is `AGENTS.md`, workspace config, repository map, active
  feature state, and current feature artifacts.
- Load `ai/knowledge/*`, `ai/tools/*`, `ai/templates/*`, design-history docs,
  and old specs only on demand.
- Knowledge guides are routed through `ai/knowledge/index.yml` or
  `select-knowledge`; select by structured fields and read only the returned
  guide paths. The knowledge layer is deterministic and does not use
  full-text/BM25 search.
- Prefer scripts for hard facts instead of adding prose to prompts.

## Script / LLM Boundary

- Scripts output hard facts, blockers, unknowns, and hints.
- LLM owns semantic routing, root-cause judgment, risk explanation, validation
  sufficiency, and tradeoff decisions.
- Automation must not make final routing decisions from natural-language
  keyword matching.
- Command templates must cite this file for the script/LLM boundary instead of
  restating the full rule block in every stage template.

## Repository Fact Source

- Use `.specify/memory/repository-map.md` for repository path, role, and
  capability ownership.
- Do not infer repository purpose by scanning source trees during early
  specification.
- Inspect source files only after affected repositories are identified.

## Runtime Investigation Hard Gates

- If repeated fixes do not change the symptom, run fact-layer collection before
  editing more code.
- For UI parity/layout issues, a first failed CSS/layout patch triggers a hard
  fact-layer gate: collect runtime DOM/CSS/computed style/box metrics through
  Chrome DevTools/CDP from the real target, or ask for copied DOM/CSS evidence,
  before making a second patch.
- For SDK/Biz issues, prefer latest configured logs after the relevant process
  exits.

## UI / UX / Copy Evidence Gate

- All UI development, UI changes, UI fixes, UX changes, icons, tooltips,
  labels, menu text, visible copy, layout, spacing, and style changes must have
  a reliable reference before implementation.
- Reliable references include original Qt UI/source/delegate/QSS/resource
  files, product design/mockup/Figma/export files, screenshots, existing
  product conventions in the target app, or explicit owner/user approval for a
  deliberate change.
- Do not invent UI shape, controls, icons, labels, tooltip text, tooltip style,
  visual hierarchy, or interaction behavior from general taste. A migration
  reference such as "icon plus tooltip" must not be implemented as a text
  button unless the spec records an explicit approved change.
- Before editing UI/UX/copy, perform a bounded search for the reference in the
  affected repositories and known design/source directories. If no reliable
  source is found, stop and route to `speckit.clarify` or
  `blocked-investigation`; do not patch by imagination.
- Every planned UI/UX/copy change must record the source path or evidence
  artifact, the target element, the expected text/icon/style/behavior, and any
  intentional delta from the source. Owner-approved `N/A` is allowed only when
  the absence of a reference is itself recorded as a product decision.

## Workflow Weight

- Use four primary implementation paths: `micro-fix`, `standard-bugfix`,
  `full-sdd`, and `blocked-investigation`.
- `validation-only` is a non-implementation mode.
- `standard-bugfix` may combine L2/L3 by keeping implementation slices in
  `plan.md`; only `full-sdd` requires a separate `tasks.md` by default.
- `full-sdd` must complete `tasks`, `analyze`, and `checklist` before
  implementation. The implementation preflight blocks if `tasks.md`,
  `analysis.md`, or `checklists/implementation-readiness.md` is missing.
- `standard-bugfix` still runs `analyze` before implementation. Run
  `checklist` too when risk is high, UI/runtime evidence is involved,
  validation readiness is non-trivial, or the change crosses SDK/Biz/UI
  boundaries.
- A user's "next stage" instruction does not override structured gates in
  `.specify/feature.json`, `workflow-state.json`, or
  `.specify/templates/layer-manifest.yml`.

## Stage Continuation Contract

- Use `ai/workflows/task-routing.md` as the single source of truth for
  auto-continue gates and stop reporting.
- Command templates should cite the central contract instead of restating or
  weakening it.

## Host Frontend Delivery Chain

- After AI changes host-embedded frontend plugin source, follow source edit ->
  frontend build -> direct runtime replacement -> real host CDP verification.
- Runtime replacement must be scoped to the explicit plugin runtime directory
  and should remove stale split chunks by default.
- Native plugin source edits use source edit -> `.plugin` build evidence because
  native output cannot be hot-updated safely.

## DesktopShell CDP Target Gate

- Before declaring host/CDP validation unavailable, run
  `ensure-desktop-shell-cdp-host` or equivalent probes. Reuse an existing
  valid DesktopShell target when one is running. If CDP is unreachable and
  no process owns the port, start the host with `npm run debug` and rerun the
  probe. If another process owns the port, identify it and stop with a real
  blocker unless the user explicitly approves a destructive recovery action.
  A running process or occupied port is not enough reason to skip to manual
  acceptance.
- Before host UI CDP evidence, inspect `/json/list` or run
  `inspect-desktop-shell-cdp-target`.
- Record all page target `id/title/url/webSocketDebuggerUrl` values and the
  selected target id/URL.
- Product UI validation must reject Plugin Workbench, `base-win.html`,
  `devtools://`, blank, and unrelated targets as `wrong-target / insufficient`.
- `Plugin Workbench|plugin-workbench.html` is valid only for plugin-host
  workbench validation.

## Qt Source Behavior Map

- For Qt-to-frontend UI parity, read `.specify/memory/qt-source-behavior-map.md`
  or `ai/knowledge/qt-source-behavior-map.md` before broad source search.
- Missing or stale map rows require bounded source investigation and active
  feature evidence; do not infer behavior from absence.

## Generated Context Drift

- `AGENTS.md`, `.specify/memory/repository-map.md`,
  `.specify/templates/layer-manifest.yml`, `ai/workflows/task-routing.md`, and
  `ai/rules/ai-coding-rules.md` are generated or shared context that may lag
  behind `tools/spec-kit` templates.
- After template/tooling changes, run `validate-generated-context` before
  relying on default context. Report missing gate phrases as blockers or
  explicit drift, not as a reason to silently skip the rule.
- After changing `ai/knowledge/index.yml` or any guide under `ai/knowledge/*`,
  run `validate-knowledge-index`. Missing guides, oversized guides, unknown
  repository keys, or machine-specific knowledge paths are context drift.

## Git and Branch Policy

- Spec branches are local-only.
- Do not push, create remote tracking branches, or create GitHub issues as part
  of the default workflow.
- Commit and branch completion require explicit user confirmation.
- Branch completion cherry-picks spec commits back to base and keeps local spec
  branches by default.

## Long-Term Asset Protection

- Do not silently edit durable rules during feature implementation.
- Durable fact updates require source evidence, reason, and validation evidence.
- Retrospective/留痕 is mandatory before commit for standard-bugfix and
  full-sdd delivery. Lesson promotion remains optional and only applies to
  human-approved candidates or explicit audit/promotion requests.
