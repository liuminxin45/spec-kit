## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Context Contract

Default context is `AGENTS.md`, `.specify/workspace.yml`, `.specify/memory/repository-map.md`, `.specify/feature.json` when present, and `ai/workflows/task-routing.md`.
Load `ai/knowledge/*`, `ai/tools/*`, `ai/templates/*`, old `specs/*`, or design-history docs only when this command explicitly needs them.
Scripts provide `facts`, `blockers`, `unknowns`, and `hints`; LLM owns semantic routing, root-cause judgment, validation sufficiency, and tradeoff decisions.
Keep this command stage-specific. Do not duplicate long-term governance prose here.

## Stage Continuation Rule

Apply the central Stage Continuation Contract from `ai/workflows/task-routing.md`; if this stage cannot execute the next required stage, report `blockers` and `next_required_human_action`.

## Purpose

After final user acceptance and before `speckit.commit`, create a lightweight
durable record of the current Spec Kit workflow. This 留痕 stage runs after
用户验收通过 and is mandatory for standard/full Spec Kit delivery before commit.
The default output is concise traceability: 关键用户输入, AI 输出与动作链, 验证证据,
最终状态, and meaningful errors when present. Expand into detailed error/rework
analysis only when the run had repeated failure, a new pitfall, a new rule, a
new automation opportunity, a tool/runtime evidence issue, or a user-approved
lesson candidate.

This stage writes feature-local retrospective artifacts only. 不自动修改 spec-kit,
memory, team governance, product code, git history, branch state, remotes, or
promote lessons or knowledge into long-term policy.

## Language Rules

- `workflow-record.md`, `improvement-candidates.md`, user-facing summaries, and
  review prompts use Chinese-first style.
- Preserve technical identifiers in their original form: paths, commands,
  commit hashes, branch names, repository names, APIs, fields, and test names.
- Separate facts from inferences. Mark inferred root causes or process lessons
  as inference unless directly evidenced.

## Execution Steps

1. Run the prerequisite script and parse `FEATURE_DIR` and `AVAILABLE_DOCS`.
2. Load available feature artifacts: `intake.md`, `spec.md`, `plan.md`,
   `tasks.md`, `progress.md`, `review.md`, `lessons.md`, `validation.md`,
   `evidence.md`, `fact-pack.md`, `acceptance.md`, `acceptance-checklist.md`,
   `checklists/`, and `FEATURE_DIR/cdp-screenshots/screenshots-index.md` when
   present.
3. Confirm final acceptance has explicit evidence.
   - For standard/full workflows, require acceptance plus quick acceptance when
     quick acceptance was required after simplify.
   - If acceptance is missing, stop and return to `speckit.acceptance`.
4. Inspect current repository state for affected repositories:
   - Current branch, changed files, validation commands/latest results, ignored
     temp/generated artifacts, and remaining dirty files that matter for commit.
5. Create or update `FEATURE_DIR/workflow-record.md` with:
   - Basic feature metadata: feature name, branch, repositories,
     delivery_profile, risk_level, acceptance status.
   - Key user inputs, including initial request, corrections, clarifications,
     runtime evidence supplied by the user, and final acceptance.
   - AI actions by stage: major outputs, edited files, validation commands,
     build/install/run evidence, and state transitions.
   - Errors and rework: symptom, incorrect assumption or failed attempt,
     evidence that exposed it, final fix, and validation evidence.
   - Root-cause categories: information gap, runtime evidence gap, source vs
     artifact confusion, planning/task gap, tooling gap, branch/multi-repo gap,
     or other.
    - Quality assessment: task output quality, workflow quality, AI execution
      quality, remaining risk, and whether the system had enough evidence.
    - Rubric readiness: list evidence paths needed for final post-commit
      Rubric scoring, including AI Self-Acceptance, API/E2E plan, plugin
      `.plugin` package evidence when applicable, CDP/runtime evidence when
      applicable, and workflow compliance risks. Do not output final Rubric
      scores in retrospective.
   - `Accepted Gaps`: owner/user-accepted validation gaps, unsupported
     automation, product tradeoffs, excluded scope, and the evidence showing
     they were accepted.
   - Local artifact visibility: whether `workflow-record.md`,
     `improvement-candidates.md`, acceptance artifacts, or spec artifacts are
     intentionally local-only or ignored by `.gitignore`.
   - AI workflow self-check: expected stage path, actual stage path, mismatch,
     evidence, and the smallest repair location when the workflow diverged.
   - Existing Constraint Audit: before recommending any new durable rule,
     inspect existing constraints first: `ai/workflows/task-routing.md`, stage
     command templates, `workflow.yml`, scripts, tests, generated skill copies,
     and selected guides. Classify missing/weak/contradictory wording,
     script/preflight wiring, generated-context drift, unavailable tool, or
     LLM execution miss; prefer strengthening existing constraints first.
   - Team knowledge candidates: stable facts that required broad or repeated
     source reading, are likely long-lived, and can be expressed without
     machine-specific paths. Record evidence and the proposed knowledge-map or
     guide location, but keep the candidate pending until human approval.
   - Advanced-model context efficiency: record decision-critical facts,
     unnecessary loaded context, missing structured fields, script-generated
     evidence candidates, and the smallest useful context contract.
6. Create or update `FEATURE_DIR/improvement-candidates.md`.
   - If no reusable lesson exists, write `status: no-candidates` and do not
     invent broad advice.
   - If candidate lessons exist, each must include type, lesson, trigger
     condition, recommended landing place, expected benefit, over-generalization
     risk, and review status `pending`.
7. For each candidate, explicitly classify whether the lesson belongs to:
   - Foundation rules or memory.
   - Work Item templates or workflow state.
   - Capabilities: skills/tools/MCP capability governance.
   - Evidence: validation/evidence/retrospective flow.
   - Tests or automation scripts.
   - TEAM-README or other team operating docs.
   This stage records the suggested landing place only; it does not apply it and
   does not require promotion when all candidates are absent or still pending.
   - Use an automation-first filter: prefer scripts, deterministic checks,
     generated facts, or rule-based gates when mechanical; do not outsource
     a deterministic check to LLM judgment.
   - Use rules or automation only for conditions that are nearly deterministic.
     If a check requires semantic judgment, tradeoff analysis, quality
     evaluation, or context-sensitive interpretation, keep it as an LLM-owned
     review item with evidence instead of forcing weak automation that lowers
     quality.
   - For each candidate, record how it improves advanced-model context
     efficiency, judgment quality, or evidence sufficiency. If it does not
     improve context efficiency, explain why the candidate is still worth
     keeping.
8. Create or update `FEATURE_DIR/knowledge-candidates.md`.
   - This file records project long-term knowledge candidates only; it never
     modifies `ai/knowledge` during retrospective.
   - New candidates must default to `人工审核结论: pending`.
   - Include source evidence, applicability boundaries, recommended knowledge
     layer, recommended guide, confidence, and pollution risk.
   - If no stable reusable project knowledge exists, write
     `status: no-candidates`.
9. Run `collect-workflow-observer-packet` to produce
   `FEATURE_DIR/workflow-observer-packet.json` for the next
   `speckit.workflow-observer` stage. Do not write `workflow-observation.md`
   in this stage unless the workflow-observer command is being executed inline.
10. Update `FEATURE_DIR/workflow-state.json`: set `retrospective.status` to
    `completed`, link `workflow-record.md`, `improvement-candidates.md`, and
    `knowledge-candidates.md`, and preserve attempts, validations, fact-layer,
    acceptance, and promotion fields.
11. Do not modify spec-kit, `.specify/memory`, team governance files, or
   generated global rules from this stage. High-value lessons require human
   approval before promotion.
12. Update `review.md` when present so the human navigation page links to
   `workflow-record.md`, `improvement-candidates.md`, and
   `knowledge-candidates.md`.
13. Continue to `speckit.workflow-observer`. Only after workflow-observer,
    continue to `speckit.promote-lessons` or `speckit.promote-knowledge` when
    there are human-approved candidates; otherwise continue to `speckit.commit`.

```

Allowed review states are `pending | approved | rejected`. Retrospective must
create project knowledge candidates as `pending`. A later
`speckit.promote-knowledge` stage may promote only candidates that a human
explicitly changes to `approved`.

## Quality Rules

- Do not treat this stage as acceptance. Acceptance must already be explicit.
- Do not promote lessons or knowledge automatically. `pending` candidates are
  review input, not team policy.
- Do not ask humans to confirm AI-owned judgments such as test sufficiency or
  root-cause correctness. If the evidence is insufficient, mark the candidate
  as low confidence or omit it.
- Prefer zero or a few high-value candidates over broad generic advice.
- Prefer automation-first improvements: deterministic checks should become
  scripts, generated facts, template gates, checklist items, or validation
  commands before LLM memory or broad AI instructions.
- Keep sensitive information, secrets, and private credentials out of the
  retrospective artifacts.

## Fact Layer Retrospective

- Record 是否及时启用 fact-layer. For repeated UI/device-state fixes, unchanged
  rebuild/reinstall results, or a second same-class fix, `workflow-record.md`
  must state whether `speckit.fact-layer` produced `fact-pack.md`, latest SDK/Biz
  logs, and runtime DOM / computed style / box metrics were collected when needed.
- Missing or late fact-layer usage should become an improvement candidate.

## Evidence Retrospective

- Record whether validation claims had concrete evidence links.
- Record whether `validation.md` summarized result interpretation and whether
  `evidence.md` stored tool/test-facing raw facts.
- If validation evidence lived only in chat, console output, or implicit memory,
  create an `improvement-candidates.md` item recommending a durable evidence
  capture rule.

## Output

Report in Chinese:

- `workflow-record.md` path.
- `improvement-candidates.md` path.
- `knowledge-candidates.md` path.
- `workflow-observer-packet.json` path.
- `workflow-state.json` retrospective status update.
- Acceptance evidence used.
- Highest-value improvement candidates.
- Confirmation that this stage did not modify spec-kit, memory, team
  governance, long-term knowledge, product code, git history, branches, or
  remotes.
- Required next stage: `speckit.workflow-observer` /
  `$speckit-workflow-observer`.
