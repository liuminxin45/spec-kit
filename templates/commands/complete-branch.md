$ARGUMENTS

## Context Contract

Default context is `AGENTS.md`, `.specify/workspace.yml`, `.specify/memory/repository-map.md`, `.specify/feature.json` when present, and `ai/workflows/task-routing.md`.
Load `ai/knowledge/*`, `ai/tools/*`, `ai/templates/*`, old `specs/*`, or design-history docs only when this command explicitly needs them.
Scripts provide `facts`, `blockers`, `unknowns`, and `hints`; LLM owns semantic routing, root-cause judgment, validation sufficiency, and tradeoff decisions.
Keep this command stage-specific. Do not duplicate long-term governance prose here.

## Stage Continuation Rule

Apply the central Stage Continuation Contract from `ai/workflows/task-routing.md`; if this stage cannot execute the next required stage, report `blockers` and `next_required_human_action`.

## Purpose

Complete the accepted local Spec branch only after commit, retrospective/留痕,
one post-commit self-check, final Rubric gates, and explicit human approval are
complete. This is the final local branch-state mutation. The default is:
preflight, ask for approval, switch back to the entry branch recorded when the
spec branch was created, cherry-pick the local spec commits there, 保留 spec
branch, 不删除 the local Spec branch, and 不 push.

## Language Rules

- Human-facing summaries use Chinese-first style.
- Preserve technical identifiers in their original form: branch names,
  repository names, script names, commands, and commit hashes.

## Execution Steps

1. Run `inspect-workflow-closure`; continue only when it returns `ok` and
   `facts.next_required_stage` is empty.
2. Run `post-commit-self-check` exactly once for the active feature. If it
   produces deterministic fixes, amend the commit once and do not repeat this
   self-check.
3. Run `validate-rubric-score` for the active feature. The final Rubric score
   must have been produced after the self-check, not during plan/implement/
   acceptance. Block complete-branch when hard gates fail, total score is below
   90, any L1-L5 score is missing, any dimension below 80 lacks blocker or
   accepted-gap evidence, evidence paths or deduction reasons are missing, or
   the complete-branch allow/deny conclusion is missing.
4. Run the configured preflight-only completion script from the Spec Kit
   repository root:
   - PowerShell: `.specify/scripts/powershell/complete-spec-branches.ps1 -Json -PreflightOnly`
5. Parse and show the preflight result for every affected repository:
    - Repository path, current branch, local spec branch, dirty state, spec branch existence, cherry-pick safety, and upstream/remote tracking.
    - Completion target branch: the recorded entry branch from `.specify/feature.json` `completion_targets`, or an explicit `-BaseBranch` override when supplied.
    - Dirty classification: tracked source changes, generated/temp/excluded untracked entries, and unclassified untracked files.
   - Remote divergence for the completion target branch when an upstream exists: ahead,
     behind, or no upstream.
    - Retrospective gate status. `workflow-record.md`, `improvement-candidates.md`, `knowledge-candidates.md`, and `workflow-observation.md` must exist; if any are missing, stop and run the closure gate's next required stage before completing the branch.
6. If preflight reports dirty files, classify before completion:
   - Tracked modifications, staged changes, deleted files, or untracked files
     in repositories that still have spec commits to cherry-pick are blockers
     unless the correct handling is clear from source evidence.
   - Untracked files in repositories that are already up to date, have no spec
     commits to cherry-pick, or are clearly temporary/generated/intermediate
     local output are not blockers. Automatically pass them, record the
     classification, and continue without manual confirmation just to ignore
     those files.
   - Stop only when the dirty file may be source work that belongs to this
     feature, may be overwritten by branch switching/cherry-pick, or cannot be
     semantically classified from repository-map, path category, git status,
     and local evidence.
7. If any remaining preflight item fails, stop and report the blocker. Do not
   partially cherry-pick repositories.
8. Ask for explicit human approval to perform the local cherry-pick branch
   completion. Do not proceed from a previous broad approval; the approval must
   refer to this preflight result.
9. Complete the branch with confirmation:
   - PowerShell: `.specify/scripts/powershell/complete-spec-branches.ps1 -Json -ConfirmCompletion`
   - Run the completion script or native git commands in a way that
     cherry-picks the local spec branch commits into the recorded entry branch
     across all affected repositories.
   - Cherry-pick target is the recorded entry branch for each repository unless
     the caller explicitly supplied `-BaseBranch`.
   - The local spec branch is kept.
   - The command does not delete local branches.
   - The command does not push or create remote tracking.
   - The command does not create merge commits.
   - Ignore untracked temporary/generated artifacts and semantically unrelated
     no-commit repository noise when deciding whether dirty state blocks
     completion. Examples include cache folders, build output, installed plugin
     artifacts, local spec-kit init output, logs, evidence/memory scratch
     output, workbench screenshots, and host descriptor mocks. Do not ignore
     tracked source changes or unclassified dirty files that may belong to the
     spec branch being completed.
   - Switch every affected repository that can be safely handled back to its
     recorded entry branch, including repositories that are already up to date
     or have no commits to cherry-pick.
   - Pass or emulate keep-branch behavior so the spec branch remains available.
   - If the packaged script only supports deletion by default, do not use the
     deleting path; perform a safe cherry-pick sequence that preserves the
     branch and record that choice.
10. Verify final repository state:
   - Current branch is the recorded entry branch in every affected repository,
     including repositories that did not produce a new cherry-pick commit.
   - Spec branch still exists.
   - No remote push occurred.
   - No remote tracking was created by this stage.
11. Update `progress.md` with completion result when present.

## Quality Rules

- Never cherry-pick when the preflight result is missing or failing.
- Never run before `speckit.retrospective` / 留痕 is complete for the feature.
- Never run before the one post-commit self-check completes.
- Never run before final Rubric score is emitted and `validate-rubric-score`
  passes.
- Never cherry-pick without explicit human approval for this preflight result.
- Treat missing `workflow-record.md`, `improvement-candidates.md`,
  `knowledge-candidates.md`, or `workflow-observation.md` as a hard completion
  blocker, even if the user says "进入下一阶段".
- Never delete the local spec branch by default.
- Never push from this stage.
- Do not hide unrelated dirty source work; report it and stop only if it blocks
  a safe cherry-pick and cannot be classified as temporary/generated output.
- If a cherry-pick conflict occurs, automatically resolve generated-artifact
  conflicts by keeping the base artifact and continuing. For source conflicts,
  continue resolving when the correct result is clear from spec/plan/tasks,
  commits, or local source evidence; only ask for human intervention when the
  semantic choice is genuinely ambiguous.

## Output

Report in Chinese:

- Preflight result.
- Post-commit self-check result.
- Rubric score and hard-gate result.
- Cherry-pick result per repository.
- Any ignored temporary/generated dirty entries or automatically resolved
  artifact conflicts.
- Confirmation that the workflow cherry-picked to the recorded entry branch, or
  the explicit `-BaseBranch` override when one was supplied.
- Confirmation that it did 保留 spec branch, 不删除 it, and 不 push.
