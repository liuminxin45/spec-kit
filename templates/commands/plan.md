## Context Contract

Default context is `AGENTS.md`, `.specify/workspace.yml`, `.specify/memory/repository-map.md`, `.specify/feature.json` when present, and `ai/workflows/task-routing.md`.
Load `ai/knowledge/*`, `ai/tools/*`, `ai/templates/*`, old `specs/*`, or design-history docs only when this command explicitly needs them.
Scripts provide `facts`, `blockers`, `unknowns`, and `hints`; LLM owns semantic routing, root-cause judgment, validation sufficiency, and tradeoff decisions.
Keep this command stage-specific. Do not duplicate long-term governance prose here.

## Stage Continuation Rule

Apply the central Stage Continuation Contract from `ai/workflows/task-routing.md`; if this stage cannot execute the next required stage, report `blockers` and `next_required_human_action`.

## Purpose

Create `plan.md` from the active `spec.md`. The plan is a decision map, not a comprehensive design manual. It must identify the facts, slices, gate packs, and validation evidence required for implementation while leaving detailed truth in code, scripts, selected facts, and source artifacts.

For `micro-fix`, keep the lightweight evidence path unless the bug is no longer micro. For `standard-bugfix-lite`, fill `workpack.md` from `.specify/templates/workpack-template.md` and avoid full `spec.md`/`plan.md` unless risk upgrades. For `blocked-investigation`, plan facts to collect instead of implementation.

## Layered Artifact Contract

- This command creates the L2 artifact set from `templates/layer-manifest.yml`.
- Required L2 outputs are `plan.md` and `workflow-state.json`.
- `standard-bugfix-lite` may use `workpack.md` plus `workflow-state.json` as
  the L2 artifact set when no high-risk gate is selected.
- `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, and `quickstart.md` are created when applicable or marked `N/A` with reasons.
- `plan.md` must include `L2 Artifact Contract` from `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`.
- `workflow-state.json` remains the structured source for attempts, validations, fact-layer, acceptance, retrospective, and promotion state.

## Language Rules

- Human-reviewed artifacts use Chinese-first style: `plan.md`, `quickstart.md`, and user-facing summaries.
- AI-oriented artifacts use English-first style: `research.md`, `data-model.md`, and `contracts/`.
- Preserve technical identifiers in their original language.
- In `contracts/`, never translate interface names, event names, JSON keys, DTO fields, status values, operation names, or protocol terms.

## Execution Steps

1. Run the setup script and parse `FEATURE_SPEC`, `IMPL_PLAN`, `SPECS_DIR`, and branch facts.
2. Load only required context:
   - `FEATURE_SPEC`
   - `SPECS_DIR/intake.md` when present
   - `.specify/feature.json` routing fields when present
   - `.specify/memory/constitution.md` when present
   - `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`
   - existing design artifacts in `SPECS_DIR` only when applicable
3. Run `select-gates` for stage `plan`.
   - Record selected gate pack paths in `AI Context Contract`.
   - Use selected packs to decide required facts and validation evidence.
4. Run `select-knowledge` only when repository-map, feature artifacts, and selected gate packs are not enough; read only returned `ai/knowledge/*` guides and do not load all guides or use full-text/BM25 search.
5. Load `speckit-test-plan` through `ai/workflows/skill-routing.yml` when changed behavior needs API, E2E/interface, regression, fixture, smoke, UI, or device test planning.
   - If the test-case plan is obvious, record `approved-by-ai-obvious` and
     keep it for final human review.
   - If test choices affect public contracts, device coverage, fixtures, test cost, or accepted gaps, stop for human review before implementation.
6. Load `speckit-quality-vision` for UI/UX/copy/parity work and create or link `quality-vision.md` with baseline screenshot/design/Qt source or owner-approved `N/A`.
7. Load `speckit-acceptance-rubric`; create or link `acceptance-rubric.md` as the judge contract for `speckit-ai-self-acceptance`.
8. Fill `plan.md` as a focused decision map:
   - `人类审核摘要`, which is navigation only and must 不得替代或删减 later AI sections.
   - `必需人工决策` only when owner/user input is truly required.
   - `AI Context Contract`: decision-critical facts, exact sources/commands, selected gate packs, context to load, context to avoid, and missing facts/blockers.
   - Delivery profile, task type, affected repositories, and routing assumptions.
   - Root Cause Evidence for bugfix work, including Counterexample, Blast Radius, and Validation Mapping.
   - `Root-Fix Decision Gate` for bugfix work: compare Root fix,
     Mitigation, Compatibility fallback, and Containment when applicable.
     Record whether each candidate eliminates the failure mechanism, whether
     scale growth can still fail, complexity/risk, compatibility/migration
     impact, validation, select/reject reason, residual risk, and follow-up
     root-fix route. Cleanup/release/reset/retry/fallback/limit-only options
     must not be described as root fix unless they eliminate the mechanism.
   - Affected modules, ownership boundaries, public contract impact, and file ownership decisions.
   - `Quality Vision Link`: quality tier, UI baseline status, and human baseline decision if any.
    - `测试用例计划`: API/E2E/interface/regression/fixture/smoke rows, review status, and N/A reasons.
   - `Acceptance Rubric Link`: rubric path, Essential/Pitfall counts, and review state.
   - Implementation Slices with allowed scope, forbidden scope, validation, progress update, and stop conditions.
   - Validation plan and `AI Self-Acceptance Contract`.
    For `standard-bugfix-lite`, place the same essentials in `workpack.md`:
    root cause, Root-Fix Decision Gate, one bounded change slice, validation,
    and acceptance-rubric summary.
9. Produce or update supporting artifacts only when the capability needs them:
   - `research.md`: unknowns, tradeoffs, prior art, source behavior discovery, and alternatives rejected.
   - `data-model.md`: durable state, DTOs, serialized fields, SDK structs, UI state, or database-like records.
   - `contracts/`: public headers, SDK APIs, bridge payloads, frontend props/events/state, CLI/script IO, or protocol terms.
   - `quickstart.md`: reviewer exercise path and preservation strategy.
10. Update `review.md` with approach, affected repositories, highest-risk boundaries, validation entry, known gaps, and links to important artifacts.
11. If a selected gate exposes missing facts, plan a bounded investigation or fact-layer slice before source edits.

## Gate Pack Planning

Gate packs are load-on-demand workflow maps under `ai/workflows/gates/*`:

- `qt-parity`: requires Qt source behavior coverage and, for cross-layer migration, a Source Behavior Execution Map.
- `host-cdp`: requires real host CDP target selection and rejects wrong-target evidence.
- `frontend-runtime-sync`: requires source edit -> frontend build -> direct runtime replacement -> real host CDP verification, followed by final `.plugin` package evidence before commit/complete-branch.
- `plugin-package`: all frontend/native/JS/plugin integration changes require the shared `.plugin` build/package gate; repository-local build/export is prerequisite evidence only.
- `native-bridge`: requires native build/export, `sync-native-runtime-artifacts`, host restart, and `validate-rpc-proto-bundle` when RPC/proto fields change.
- `real-device`: requires AI-owned service/runtime/device validation unless a real external blocker is proven.

Do not paste full gate details into `plan.md`; cite selected gate ids and record only the facts needed for this capability.

## Planning Rules

- Prefer existing architecture and helper APIs.
- Treat context as an engineering input. Do not stuff the plan with broad background; put avoided context under `Context To Avoid`.
- Use bounded search from repository-map, affected repositories, known module directories, and named symbols/files with `rg`; do not scan the whole `workspace_root`.
- Do not spawn a subagent/explorer for simple local lookup.
- If root cause is unknown, write a bounded investigation slice with search scope, command budget, stop conditions, and evidence to collect.
- For bugfixes, prefer a root fix that eliminates the failure category. If
  cost, risk, or compatibility makes that unacceptable now, mark the selected
  approach as mitigation, containment, or compatibility fallback and retain the
  residual risk, scale boundary, and follow-up root-fix route.
- Do not use "current project is enough" as the reason to mark a local fix as
  root fix. Record future compatibility cost, scale boundary, and the trigger
  for upgrading to root fix.
- For migration, do not plan implementation without source behavior reference or explicit owner-approved N/A.
- For UI/UX changes, every new or modified icon, tooltip, label, menu item, button, layout/style rule, and visible interaction state must cite a reliable source.
- For UI parity work, selected gate packs must name source behavior, target UI, UI element traversal inventory, dynamic states, host validation, scrollbar, clipping, compression, and runtime DOM / computed style / box metrics evidence.
- For host-embedded frontend work, static design files alone are insufficient; plan dynamic states, geometry constraints, runtime DOM/computed/box metrics, and host-level validation.
- `bridge/adaptor` is forwarding-only. Runtime facts belong in `owning runtime/domain repository`; UI-display structure belongs in frontend plugin source.
- Cross-boundary device identity is UUID decimal string only. Do not expose SDK native ids, virtual ids, handles, or parallel frontend ids above their owner layer.
- Do not dump unrelated responsibilities into one interface/data-layer file.
- Do not use `Known Gaps` to pass the exact risk introduced by the fix. That is blocking or high risk, not PASS.
- A `Known Gap` on changed core behavior remains blocking unless explicitly owner-approved.
- Do not let AI freely invent test coverage. API/E2E/interface test-case rows must trace to scenarios, requirements, contracts, or risk; ambiguous plans require human review before implementation.
- Do not let AI self-acceptance judge UI without a baseline in `quality-vision.md` or an explicit owner-approved `N/A`.
- `acceptance-rubric.md` must include self-contained Essential and Pitfall criteria before code changes for non-trivial implementation work.
- Plan acceptance, simplify, optional test-hardening, retrospective, workflow-observer, optional promote-lessons/promote-knowledge, commit, one post-commit self-check, final Rubric score, and complete-branch as separate stages.

## Human Review Rules

- `## 人类审核摘要` must be concise: goal, real scope, validation entry, remaining risk, and next stage.
- Add `## 必需人工决策` only for product/business choices, owner-approved gaps, external validation AI cannot perform, user acceptance, commit, or branch completion.
- Do not ask the developer to confirm root cause correctness, test sufficiency, fallback quality, or ordinary technical plan quality. If uncertain, mark the plan blocked or high risk.

## Fact Layer Planning

- Use `speckit.fact-layer` and plan `fact-pack.md` when runtime DOM, console, computed style, box metrics, latest service/runtime logs, or source/runtime/build/install consistency evidence is needed.
- Treat a second same-class fix without new facts as a planning risk and route to fact-layer before implementation. Use chrome-devtools or equivalent runtime evidence for computed style and box metrics.

    summary; otherwise upgrade to `standard-bugfix` or `blocked-investigation`.
  - `standard-bugfix`: `speckit.analyze` / `$speckit-analyze` when `plan.md` contains complete `Implementation Slices`; otherwise `speckit.tasks`.
  - `micro-fix`: `speckit.implement` only when lightweight evidence names changed files, validation, stop conditions, and root cause.
  - `blocked-investigation`: `speckit.fact-layer` or `speckit.bounded-investigation`.
  - `validation-only`: `speckit.validation`.
