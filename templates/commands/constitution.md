$ARGUMENTS
```

## Context Contract

Default context is `AGENTS.md`, `.specify/workspace.yml`, `.specify/memory/repository-map.md`, `.specify/feature.json` when present, and `ai/workflows/task-routing.md`.
Load `ai/knowledge/*`, `ai/tools/*`, `ai/templates/*`, old `specs/*`, or design-history docs only when this command explicitly needs them.
Scripts provide `facts`, `blockers`, `unknowns`, and `hints`; LLM owns semantic routing, root-cause judgment, validation sufficiency, and tradeoff decisions.
Keep this command stage-specific. Do not duplicate long-term governance prose here.

## Stage Continuation Rule

Apply the central Stage Continuation Contract from `ai/workflows/task-routing.md`; if this stage cannot execute the next required stage, report `blockers` and `next_required_human_action`.

## Purpose

Create or update `.specify/memory/constitution.md` as the stable engineering
contract for owning runtime/domain repository, host application, native plugin/bridge/adaptor bridge, SDK integration,
frontend plugin, and migration work.

The constitution should describe principles and decision rules. Do not turn it
into a full project directory map. Project structure belongs in `plan.md` under
affected modules and project structure; the constitution only defines how the
team treats boundaries, compatibility, verification, and change control.

## Entry Context

- `AGENTS.md` is the AI entry file installed by Spec Kit.
- `ai/workflows/task-routing.md` defines workflow routing categories and the
  script-facts / LLM-judgment boundary.
- This command maintains durable principles only. The canonical rule templates
  are `ai/rules/engineering-principles.md`,
  `ai/rules/architecture-constraints.md`, and
  `ai/rules/ai-coding-rules.md`.
- Do not move repository maps,
  workflow routing, tool policies, or per-feature artifacts into the
  constitution.
- Do not silently edit durable rule files. Knowledge updates under `ai/knowledge/*`
  require source evidence, reason, validation evidence, and human approval.

## Language Rules

- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is human-reviewed governance material.
  Write it in Chinese-first style.
- Preserve technical identifiers in their original form: repository names,
  file paths, module names, APIs, fields, enum/status values, commands, and
  workflow constants.

## Required Principles

Use these defaults unless the user explicitly overrides them:

1. Minimal scoped change
   - Prefer the smallest change that satisfies the capability.
   - Avoid unrelated refactors, formatting churn, or metadata churn.

2. Existing patterns first
   - Read nearby code, scripts, build files, and existing plugin conventions
     before inventing a new abstraction.
   - Match existing naming, ownership boundaries, and error handling style.

3. Interface compatibility first
   - Treat public SDK headers, native plugin/bridge/adaptor bridge contracts, plugin APIs, frontend
     extension contracts, and serialized status fields as compatibility
     boundaries.
   - Any breaking change must be explicit, justified, and accompanied by an
     impact and migration note.

4. Real validation loop
   - Prefer concrete build, unit, smoke, runtime, or device validation evidence.
   - If verification cannot be run, record the gap and the exact follow-up.

5. Device and runtime truth
   - Do not fake SDK, camera, transport, status, permission, or handle state.
   - Preserve real device names, real SDK/cache status, and real operation
     permissions unless the spec explicitly defines a simulation boundary.

6. UI display, service bridge, and runtime truth boundary
   - `bridge/adaptor` is an API forwarding bridge only. It must not implement
     business logic, device-state inference, permission/availability decisions,
     UI behavior calculation, or durable business models.
   - Non-UI-specific runtime facts, device/cache/handle/transport/permission
     data, and reusable business rules belong in `owning runtime/domain repository`.
   - Business-side code used only to display the current UI, such as UI
     interaction surface structure, ordering, visible/enabled presentation, and
     action entry composition, belongs in the frontend plugin and must be based on
     `owning runtime/domain repository` facts obtained through the bridge.
   - Frontend code must not infer runtime/permission truth from labels/strings,
     fake device state, or persist device/runtime/permission business state as
     truth.

7. Identity, state, and API single ownership
   - Across `owning runtime/domain repository` facade, `bridge/adaptor`, N-API/JSON/RPC, JS, and
     UI, the only device identity is UUID decimal string. C++ internals may use
     `uint64_t uuid`, but `deviceIndex`, `deviceId`, `handleId`,
     `virtualDeviceId`, SDK native IDs, and SDK handles must not become public
     or bridge/UI identities.
   - UUID generation belongs only to `device::identity::generateUUID()`.
     `DeviceManager`, `SdkService`, bridge code, and UI code consume that
     identity; they do not define separate generation rules.
   - SDK native IDs, virtual device IDs, and handles stay inside the lowest SDK
     integration layer. Virtual and real devices expose the same UUID semantics
     outside that layer.
   - Frontend business operations use `node.uuid` only. `node.id` is a UI tree
     node identity, not a device identity, and must not be used with
     `entityId`, `metadata.uuid`, or similar fallbacks for device operations.
   - Events are refresh triggers only. After connect/disconnect/acquisition/
     runtime events, UI refreshes from `bridge/adaptor`, and `bridge/adaptor`
     forwards to `owning runtime/domain repository`; event payloads do not become a parallel truth
     store.
   - Functionally equivalent old APIs should be removed or migrated instead of
     coexisting with the new production API. Debug/test facades and temporary
     SDK passthroughs must stay in tests or scripts, not production service exports.
   - Names must express real semantics: use `uuid`, `deviceUuids`, `nodeId`, or
     `listIndex` as appropriate; avoid ambiguous `deviceId`.
   - Generated artifacts such as `build/`, `export/`, and `plugin-out/` must
     not affect interface ownership, package-source selection, or diff
     judgment.
   - Frontend/native plugin changes must be made in repository source files,
     not installed runtime plugin directories or built artifacts. Installed
     `app-data/plugins/**`, host-served `frontend/plugins/**`, `dist/`,
     `build/`, `export/`, and `plugin-out/` outputs are validation/deployment
     artifacts unless a repository explicitly treats them as source. Emergency
     runtime artifact patches must be ported back to source before
     acceptance/commit and excluded from commits.

8. Interface and data file ownership
   - Before adding interface/data-layer code, search existing ownership
     locations and nearby modules.
   - If no suitable home exists, create focused files for contract, DTO,
     bridge API, runtime/permission model, UI display model, adapter, or serialization responsibilities instead
     of growing a single unrelated file.

9. Encoding and localization boundaries
   - Treat native string encoding, UTF-8 conversion, and localized display text
     as explicit boundary decisions.
   - Convert at the documented output boundary, not opportunistically inside
     unrelated layers.

10. Local-only Spec branch workflow
   - Each Spec starts on a local `NNN-short-name` spec branch.
   - Multi-repo Specs must create or switch every affected repository to the
     same local spec branch.
   - A Spec is complete only after user acceptance, required commit work, and
     all affected repositories cherry-pick the spec branch commits back to the
     entry branch recorded at spec branch creation.
   - Branch completion keeps the local spec branch by default; deletion is not
     part of the default workflow.
   - The agent must request and receive explicit user confirmation before
     running any command that commits or cherry-picks branch completion.
   - Spec Kit must not push branches, create remote tracking branches, or
     generate GitHub issues as part of the workflow.

11. Evidence before implementation
   - A capability should move from spec to plan to tasks with enough context for
     another engineer or agent to understand scope, affected files, risks, and
     validation expectations.

## Update Steps

1. Read the current `.specify/memory/constitution.md` if it exists.
2. If the constitution is missing, use Spec Kit's bundled init-source
   constitution template. This one-time template is not installed under
   `.specify/templates`.
3. Merge user input with the default principles above.
4. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
5. If a principle changes existing feature work, add an "Amendment Impact"
   section listing which specs, plans, tasks, or templates should be revisited.

## Output

Report in Chinese:

- Constitution path.
- Version or amendment summary.
- Principles added, changed, or removed.
- Any downstream artifacts that should be updated.
- Required next stage for a new feature workflow: `speckit.intake` /
  `$speckit-intake`, unless the user is only maintaining constitution text.
- Human review prompt:
  - Ask the developer to review the constitution changes and confirm whether
    downstream templates or active specs need adjustment.
  - If adjustment is needed, update the constitution and ask for review again.
  - If no adjustment is needed and a feature workflow is starting, tell the
    developer the only next step is `speckit.intake` / `$speckit-intake`.
